# Document Classifier
**2021 Senior design project:**  
This repository will contain all source code, documentation, and project files for the Document Classifier.  

# Setup  
+ To run the pdf_reader, flask must be installed. As a very simple flask reader the only command needed is app.run().  
+ To use the databose_ops file, you must first setup AWS. It is pretty easy to configure and the code is well commented; following the comments will allow it to work, which includes setting up an amazon s3 bucket. To use database_ops, after running the code simply enter the function you would like to use. Everything regarding the database is done behind the scenes.
+ The previous source code from the identidoc team can be run by following the instructions in set_up_identidoc.txt.
