# system info #
# This has only been tested on ubuntu server 20.04, although it should work on other builds with these scripts.
# I'm using a single core, 2gb ram, 10gb virtual hard drive Oracle VM Virtual Box to run this. 
	# If using NAT for network connectivity(recommended) you must port forward port 5000 if you would like to access identidoc from the host machine. 
	# Before writing the rule, run "hostname -I" and copy that ip address, that will be your Guest IP
	# To write the rule, go into the VM settings, then to network, make sure adapter 1 says attached to NAT, click the advanced dropdown, and select port forwarding. 
	# Add a rule and write
		# Name: "anything you want"
		# Protocol: TCP
		# Host IP: 0.0.0.0
		# Host Port: 5000
		# Guest IP: *result from the command hostname -I that we ran above*
		# Guest Port: 5000
	# To connect from host machine type: "localhost:5000" in the web browser
  
# shared folders on VM #
# set uo the shard folder in the vm
# follow the link below instructions carefully
